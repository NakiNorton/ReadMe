# Read Me
This project represents the collaborative efforts of Amy Karanze, Nicole Latifi, Stephanie Norton, and Jake West.

## Overview
Read Me is a web application we built that connects users to various New York Times Best Sellers Lists. For our group project during Module 3 of the Turing School of Software and Design, we were asked to built a web application that incorporates technology unfamiliar to us. Our group integrated Redux as our "stretch tech," to aid us in managing global state.
